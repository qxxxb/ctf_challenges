# Poison Prime

It's Diffie-Hellman, but the parameters are weird.

## Overview

Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt some plaintext, but we
get to pick the prime `p`. The goal is to decrypt the plaintext within 30
seconds to get the flag.

```python
class DiffieHellman:
    def __init__(self, p: int):
        self.p = p
        self.g = 8
        self.private_key = crr.getrandbits(128)

    def public_key(self) -> int:
        return pow(self.g, self.private_key, self.p)

    def shared_key(self, other_public_key: int) -> int:
        return pow(other_public_key, self.private_key, self.p)


def get_prime() -> int:
    p = int(input("Please help them choose p: "))
    q = int(
        input(
            "To prove your p isn't backdoored, "
            + "give me a large prime factor of (p - 1): "
        )
    )

    if (
        cun.size(q) > 128
        and p > q
        and (p - 1) % q == 0
        and cun.isPrime(q)
        and cun.isPrime(p)
    ):
        return p
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid prime")


def main():
    print("Note: Your session ends in 30 seconds")

    message = "My favorite food is " + os.urandom(32).hex()
    print("Alice wants to send Bob a secret message")

    p = get_prime()
    alice = DiffieHellman(p)
    bob = DiffieHellman(p)

    shared_key = bob.shared_key(alice.public_key())
    assert shared_key == alice.shared_key(bob.public_key())

    aes_key = hashlib.sha1(cun.long_to_bytes(shared_key)).digest()[:16]
    cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(cup.pad(message.encode(), 16))

    print("Here's their encrypted message: " + ciphertext.hex())

    guess = input("Decrypt it and I'll give you the flag: ")
    if guess == message:
        print("Congrats! Here's the flag: " + os.environ["FLAG"])
    else:
        print("That's wrong dingus")
```

## Solution

Vulnerabilities:
- We pick `p`
- `g` is 8

We are also required to provide a large prime factor (128 bits) `q` for `p - 1`
so:
- Using Pohlig-Hellman to compute the discrete log isn't possible to do in 30
  seconds (and actually the public key isn't even given)
- However, a small subgroup confinement attack might work

Luckily `g = 8` is a power of 2, so the trick is to use a Mersenne prime
`p == 2^k - 1`. Here's the reasoning as explained by Robin Jadoul:

> The order of 2 (`mod 2^k - 1`) would be k, since `2^k mod (2^k - 1)` is
> obviously 1. So the order of `8` is at most `k` since `8 = 2^3`, which is in
> the subgroup of 2.

We can find a list of Mersenne primes here: https://www.mersenne.org/primes/

Next we have to pick one where `p - 1` has a prime factor of at least 128 bits.
Luckily, we can find that `2^2203 - 1` has one on
[factordb](http://factordb.com/index.php?query=2%5E2203+-+2).

Now we have a `p` (and a `q` to show it's not backdoored) where `g` is confined
to a small subgroup. Solve script in `solve.py`:
